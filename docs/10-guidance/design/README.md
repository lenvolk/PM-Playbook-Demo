# Design (PM checklist)

Use this page to ensure requirements include design expectations and common UI states.

## What PMs should capture
- **User journey:** entry points, primary tasks, exit points
- **States:** empty, loading, error, success, partial success
- **Content:** terminology, microcopy, error messages, help text
- **Responsive behavior:** small/large screens, zoom behavior
- **Localization:** text expansion, date/number formats (if applicable)
- **Consistency:** align with existing patterns/components

## Triggers: when to involve design/content
- New page/surface or significant interaction changes
- Introducing new terminology or user-facing messaging
- Complex error handling or multi-step flows

## Evidence / artifacts to link
- Wireframes or design mockups
- Content guidelines (if you have them)
- Component/pattern references
