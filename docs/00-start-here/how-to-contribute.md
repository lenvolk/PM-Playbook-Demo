# How to contribute

## Contribution principles
- Optimize for **reuse**: if it helps a PM write a requirement, capture it here.
- Optimize for **clarity**: use short sections, bullets, and examples.
- Optimize for **traceability**: link to ADO work items when applicable.

## Making changes
1. Create a branch.
2. Edit/add Markdown under `docs/`.
3. Open a pull request.
4. Request review from the appropriate owners (see `CODEOWNERS` if configured).

## Writing style
- Prefer checklists.
- Avoid policy language unless it is officially approved.
- Include "what good looks like" examples when possible.

## Adding new guidance
When adding a new guidance item:
1. Update the relevant guidance page under `docs/10-guidance/...`.
2. Update or add an ADO snippet under `docs/20-templates/ado-snippets/`.
3. Add at least one example under `docs/30-examples/` (if you have one).
